# ResoTransport

A Ruby gem for connecting to and interacting with RESO WebAPI services.  Learn more about what that is by checking out the [RESO WebAPI](https://www.reso.org/reso-web-api/) Documentation.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reso_transport'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install reso_transport

## Usage


### Getting Connected

There are 2 strategies for authentication. 

**Bearer Token**

It's simple to use a static access token if your token never expires:

```ruby
  @client = ResoTransport::Client.new({
    md_file: METADATA_CACHE,
    endpoint: ENDPOINT_URL
    authentication: {
      access_token: TOKEN,
      token_type: "Bearer" # this is the default and can be ommitted
    }
  })
```


**Authorization Endpoint**

If the connection requires requesting a new token periodically, it's easy to provide that information:

```ruby
  @client = ResoTransport::Client.new({
    md_file: METADATA_CACHE,
    endpoint: ENDPOINT_URL
    authentication: {
      endpoint: AUTH_ENDPOINT,
      client_id: CLIENT_ID,
      client_secret: CLIENT_SECRET,
      grant_type: "client_credentials", # these are the default and can be ommitted
      scope: "api"                      # 
    }
  })
```

This will pre-fetch a token from the provided endpoint when the current token is either non-existent or has expired.


### Resources

Once you have a successful connection you can explore what resources are available from the API:


```ruby
  @client.resources
  #=> {"Property"=>#<ResoTransport::Resource entity_set="Property", schema="ODataService">, "Office"=>#<ResoTransport::Resource entity_set="Office", schema="ODataService">, "Member"=>#<ResoTransport::Resource entity_set="Member", schema="ODataService">}

  @client.resources["Property"]
  #=> #<ResoTransport::Resource entity_set="Property", schema="ODataService"> 

  @client.resources["Property"].query.limit(1).results
  #=> Results Array
```

#### Querying

ResoTransport provides powerful querying capabilities:

To get 10 listings in Los Angeles between 900K and 1M and at least 5 bedrooms:
```ruby
  @resource.query.eq(City: "Los Angeles").le(ListPrice: 1_000_000).ge(ListPrice: 900_000, Bedrooms: 5).limit(10).results
```

To get 10 listings in Los Angeles OR Hollywood between 900K and 1M and at least 5 bedrooms:
```ruby
  @resource.query.any { eq(City: "Los Angeles").eq(City: "Hollywood") }.le(ListPrice: 1_000_000).ge(ListPrice: 900_000, Bedrooms: 5).limit(10).results
```



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
